An Amazon S3 bucket is a public cloud storage resource available in Amazon Web Services' (AWS) Simple Storage Service (S3), an object storage offering. Amazon S3 buckets, which are similar to file folders, store objects, which consist of data and its descriptive metadata.

Creating a client

When you create the client, you should specify an AWS Region, to create the client in. If you donâ€™t specify a Region, Amazon S3 creates the client in US East (N. Virginia) by default Region. To create a client to access a dual-stack endpoint, you must specify an AWS Region,. For more information, see Dual-stack endpoints.

When you create a client, the Region maps to the Region-specific endpoint. The client uses this endpoint to communicate with Amazon S3:

s3.<region>.amazonaws.com

For example, if you create a client by specifying the eu-west-1 Region, it maps to the following Region-specific endpoint:

s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com
